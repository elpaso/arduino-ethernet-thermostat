The project consists in an arduino controller connected to a number of 
DS18B20 sensors (one for each room) and to a relay array which controls
the main pump and one 220V valve for each room.

The pushbuttons will allow the user to set the program for each room, 
choosen from a set of predefined programs (in a future version the 
programs will be editable via menu) and through the LCD screen the
status of each room can be monitored.
